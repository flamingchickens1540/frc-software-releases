## Team 174: Arctic Warriors (Java/Command-Based)

> * Java simulator - Unobtrusive "simulator" that can be used with any teams java code. It sounds like we took a similar approach to what team 254 did
> * Custom SmartDashboard widgets - Custom widgets to show robot state, motion profiling state, and our autonomous editor
> * Autonomous Scripting - Command based autonomous scripts. Stored as text files on the robot, can be edited from the SmartDashboard
> * Motion Profiling - I had my students hand roll a simple version for straight paths. We also took team 254's spline library as is.

> In developing our software this year, we tried to have a more structured design process. We made a design notebook for our entire robot which will be released at a later date, including class diagrams and sequence diagram. We used the Agile methodology to develop our software, which worked quite well with the structure of a FIRST season and our constantly changing requirements

## Team 254: The Cheesy Poofs (Java/WPILib)

> This yearâ€™s software includes new features such as a test harness and simulator code to run the program on a computer, web-based graphing tools, constants editor, and autonomous selection, blocking autonomous routines, and a controller that calculates and follows a trapezoidal motion profile, on the fly.

## Team 423: Simple Machines (LabVIEW)

> As our robot code approaches its zenith, I wanted to share it with the Chief Delphi community for people to learn from, possibly to get suggestions, and to show the world how the Simple Machines works. Nice and simple; our code is like our machines. Features: autonomous recorder and playback, mecanum driving, pneumatic elevator, and a cool dashboard.

## Team 488: Xbot (Java/Command-Based)

> Our code release comes in two parts: Our 2015 code, and the library we began to construct out of it.

> We put a large focus on testability via injection. This has been the biggest benefit so far - given that our programming team can range between 3-8 members, there's a lot of contention to test things on the actual machine (which may or may not be ready for weeks regardless!). 

> One quick disclaimer for the CommonLib and RobotTemplate (which you'll see on the repository): 
 This repository is still very much a work in progress! There are chunks of code and build steps missing here that would probably block you from directly integrating this into your robot.
 
 > It's getting more complete every week, but as it stands, we recommend that you use parts of this repository rather than the whole of it - taking individual classes, or using the design as inspiration, rather than seeing it as a stable platform for robot development.

## Team 624: CRyptonite (LabVIEW)

>  This includes a library for using CAN Talons in LabVIEW with limited memory overhead, a scripted autonomous structure and text editor with a customizable programming language, and our version of Smart Dashboard which uses UDP instead of Network Tables. It also contains our offseason RGB lights code.

>  We experimented with Feed Forward and Motion Profiling in the fall. With some tuning, I was able to get our 2015 bot and a kitbot to go any distance I wanted without encoders (within an inch or two). I am still working on the integration with Feedback to make it more accurate and the latest code will be available on Github. This project may not be able to be opened until Kickoff because older versions of LabVIEW do not support projects built under Beta.

## Team 1410: The Kraken (C++/Command-Based)

> You may notice two weird things. The first is the array and method at the top of the OI. These are used to add a dead-zone into the controller, making them less sensitive. The second would be the SimultaneousOp CommandGroups in the IntakeArms and CanManipulator Commands folders. These are used so that we can both drive the rollers/arms, and the elevator/arms simultaneously. We could have had a command for this, but by using a command group we can also use the separate commands outside of it.

## Team 1540: The Flaming Chickens (Java/CCRE)

>  We ran our robot software department on a code-review setup: everything got developed in a separate branch, pull-requested, and code-reviewed before merge. [You can see the log of this on the project page.](https://github.com/flamingchickens1540/quasar-helios-2015/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) 107 pull requests!
> This ended up working really well for us - it allowed us to edit each other's code to be higher quality in a way that gave everyone rapid feedback and allowed team members to become much better programmers over the course of the season.
>
> (Also, for reference, our code uses [the Common Chicken Runtime Engine](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=130813), our dataflow-based robot code framework, which should explain some of the nonstandard coding.)
> 
> One other thing that helped: multi-layered autonomous modes. Some of our modes would pick up totes. To do this, they would start the pseudo-autonomous mode for autoloading (which was also used by the drivers), which would, in turn, also start the pseudo-autonomous mode for automatically controlling the elevator stacking sequence (also available to the drivers separately.)

## Team 2062: C.O.R.E 2062 (C++/WPILib)

>  This year we added a better way of examining match data by putting match data onto a file that we can look on after a match. We also experimented heavily with PID and added some functionality in the library to compliment it in the future. Lastly we tried to find a better way to manage the smartdashboard but it is currently incomplete and will most likely be finished in the of season. Other than that there were a few minor tweaks and additions.

## Team 2067: Apple PI (LabVIEW)

> The most interesting parts are the Swerve Drive folder, and the AppleScript folder. AppleScript is a scripting language that is used to rapidly develop autonomous code, and is then executed by an interpreter in LabVIEW. The script is stored on the driver station computer, and is sent to the robot over network tables whenever an update is made.

## Team 2084: Robots by the C (Java/Command-Based)

> * Flexible drive system that makes it easy to implement different drive systems. The mecanum code features support for gyros and wheel encoders, but not everything is fully tested.
> * ParameterCommand - allows Commands to have parameters that can be set from the SmartDashboard.
> * State machines to control other robot subsystems.
> * Semi-functional driver for the ITG3200 gyro (we didn't use it).
> * Slider - a simple slider control, something that is missing from the built in widgets.
> * ParameterCommand - widget that displays the parameters from a ParameterCommand on the robot
> * WheelController - Used in conjunction with our drive code to display throttle, current and other values from our motors.
> * VideoServer - allows for streaming of any OpenCV image over http as an mjpg. It could probably use some improvement, but it works okay. It was ported from a (non-FRC) C++ version I wrote earlier, which I released [here](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1438448&postcount=36), in case anyone wants to see it.

## Team 2614: MARS (LabVIEW)

> Of note in this code is our autonomous play infrastructure which is described in the attached document. In summary, the infrastructure uses parameterized commands to develop autonomous plays. Once the basic commands are created, no further modifications to robot code are needed. An external labview application runs on a separate laptop or the driver station laptop. This application connects to the robot and reads the available commands. You then build plays using the commands and adding values for the parameters. Commands can be run sequentially or indicated to be run concurrently. Each play is a separate file stored on the robot which can then be selected from a pulldown menu in the DS. Plays can be rapidly modified and rerun (like on a practice field) because no code deployment is needed.

## Team 3467: The Windham Windup (Java/Command-Based)

> Typical FRC code, just as WPI likes it. There are a few neat features that we added at competitions to meet our needs:

> The 2015 code has a feature where it will not report that the code has "started" until we see that the smart dashboard has connected - which picks our autonomous mode. We accomplish this by extending IterativeRobot.class (ours is IterativeRobotCustom) and not executing the line that tells the FMS the code has started (FRC.ObserveUserProgramStarting()) until we receive a user's click on a smart dashboard item.

> Also, the 2015 code will crash the code (throws an exception) if the driver's joystick calibrates improperly. When this happens, the LED strip on the driver console lights up bright red and the user needs to restart the code and recalibrate the stick (unplug and plug back in, hit F1). This code also has an implementation of the [PulsedLight LIDAR-lite](https://engineering.purdue.edu/477grp7/datasheets/lidar.pdf) module, and changes the colors of the driver station LEDs according to the distance, which helps us line up at the human feeder station.
